1.3.0.0
  - PoDoFo updated to 0.9.5 release
  - Fixed an issue with text-only meta file drawing
  - Added new parameter to LoadFromFile(), LoadFromFileW() and LoadFromData()
    to support incremental updates
  - Completely rewritten API for digital signatures, which also allows to prepare
    signature field or sign an already existing signature field

    and Pascal interfaces have also MMToUnit/InchToUnit helper
    functions and their reverse versions UnitToMM/UnitToInch.
  - API change in some C++ and Pascal getters to rather return the value,
    then pass it in an out parameter.
